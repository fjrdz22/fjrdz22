## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# Francisco Javier â€” Data Analytics & Lite Data Engineering (Remote-Ready)

I turn raw, messy data into clear business decisions. My toolbelt: **Excel + Power Query**, **SQL**, and **Python** (pandas). I focus on building analyses and small ETL systems that stand up in the real worldâ€”simple to run, documented, and decision-ready.

### What Iâ€™m great at
- **Data Analyst:** KPI design, advanced Excel models, Power Query transformations, SQL analysis, clean visuals + storytelling.
- **Data Engineer (lite):** Ingesting APIs â†’ staging in **SQLite/DuckDB**, transforming with SQL, and handing clean tables to BI.

### Highlight Projects
- **Healthcare Readmissions (Excel + Power Query):** Variance analysis by condition, KPI cards, state heatmap, and executive summary. *Impact:* surfaces cost-saving targets within minutes.
- **API â†’ SQLite ETL (Python + Power Query):** Pulls market data on a schedule, validates, writes to SQLite, and feeds Excel dashboards.
- **Sales vs Activity Drivers (SQL + Forecasting in Excel):** Correlates sales to drilling/completions activity; robust to pull-ins and outliers.
- **Mini Warehouse (SQLite + DuckDB):** Dim/Fact layout, SQL transforms, and tests; easy to reproduce locally on a Mac.

### Tech
Excel â€¢ Power Query â€¢ SQL (SQLite/DuckDB) â€¢ Python (pandas) â€¢ Power BI/Tableau (viewer) â€¢ Git/GitHub

**Open to remote roles**: Data Analyst or Data Engineer (entry-to-mid).
